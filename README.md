Hello guys, my name is Shaheer and I am a student at FAST. I have interests in multiple programming fields, from Web Development to Cloud Data Engineering and am wondering what to do.  

## About Me  

I'm currently focused on building a solid foundation in programming and exploring different areas of computer science to find where I fit best. My current learning revolves around understanding core logic and structured problem-solving.  

## Current Learning Goals   
1. Grasp the fundamentals of C programming  
2. Practice problem-solving techniques using basic algorithms  
3. Write clean and efficient code following good structure  

## Broader Areas of Interest   
- Web development   
- Cloud data engineering and storage systems  
- Scalable applications and system design  

My approach right now is to stay consistent and focus on the essentials  **_mastering the basics_** before jumping into advanced topics.
